                Q:- Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content font-medium text-lg">
                <p> <b><u>Ans:-</u></b><br><br>var, let, and const are three different ways to declare variables in JavaScript.
                    var declarations are globally scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be
                    updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const
                    variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They have different scopes . Their scopes
                    are:<br><br><b>"var":</b><br>1. Function Scope => Variables declared with var are function-scoped,
                    which means they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared in the function.
                    Example: function price() {
                    if (true) {
                    var x = 90;
                    }
                    console.log(x);};<br>2. Hoisting scope => Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of
                    their global scope. This means that use a var variable before it's declared, it won't result in an
                    error, but the value of the variable will be undefined.<br><br><b>"let":</b><br>1.Block Scoped =>
                    Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest
                    enclosing block . This includes loops, if statements, and functions. Example: if (true) {
                    let a = 10;
                    let b = 10;

                    console.log(a);
                    console.log(b); };<br>2.No Hoisting => let declarations are not hoisted. Then can't access a let
                    variable before it's declared within the same block.Example: function example() {
                    if (true) {
                    let y = 20;
                    }
                    console.log(y);} output is undefined because console.log(y) is not access in if
                    statement.<br><br><b>"const":</b><br>1.Block Scoped => Like let variable, variables declared with
                    const are block-scoped.<br>2.Immutable => Variables declared with const are constant and cannot be
                    reassigned after their initial assignment. But objects and arrays declared with const, the reference
                    to the object or array is constant, but the properties or elements inside them can be
                    modified.Example: const pi = 3.14;
                    pi = 3.14159; or const array = [2,3,4];
                    array.push(7);here it's modified.<br><br>In modern JavaScript, it's recommended to use let and const
                    over var because they offer block scoping, don't hoist variables, and provide better error handling.
                    Use const when need to declare a variable that won't be reassigned,and use let when need a variable
                    that can be reassigned within its scope.

                Q:- Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content font-medium text-lg">
                <p><b><u>Ans:-</u></b><br><br>Null and undefined are two distinct concepts in JavaScript. They are used in different
                    contexts. Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.The
                    typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. <br> Null means an empty value or a
                    blank value. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is
                    assigned as null.<br> they have many use cases :<br> <b><u>null :</u></b><br>1. Absence of Value => null is
                    often used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value for a variable, object property, or
                    function return.&nbsp; Example: let price = null;<br>2. Initial Default Value => sometimes we use
                    null as the initial default value for a variable, and then assign a meaningful value in those
                    variable like let price = null; price = 40;<br>3. Clear values => null is used to reset or clear a
                    variable or property when variable or property need to make it empty or non-existent.
                    <br><br><b><u>undefined:</u></b> <br> 1. Uninitialized Variables => when a variable or object property is
                    declared but not assigned a value, it's considered undefined until it takes a value. It's called
                    uninitialized variables. <br> <br>2. Function Return => when a function doesn't return a value, it
                    returns undefined by default. This can be used to indicate that the function doesn't have a return
                    value. Example: function totalPrice(){}; output is undefined.<br><br> 3. Function Parameter => When a
                    function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters,if there has missing parameters
                    then its output for missing parameters is undefined.<br> Example: function person(name,age){
                    console.log(name);<br>console.log(age);
                    } person("Rika"); Thats is undefined.<br><br>4. Accessing Non-Existent Object Properties => When access
                    a property of an object that doesn't exist, then returns undefined. Example: let person ={age:20};
                    console.log(person.name);<br><br> null and undefined are related to the absence of value, they are
                    not the same. Handling these values properly is crucial to avoid unexpected errors and bugs in js
                    code. </p>

                Q:- What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content font-medium text-lg">
                <p><b><u>Ans:-</u></b><br><br>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                    Interface. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or
                    representational state transfer architectural style. A RESTful API is one of the many possible ways
                    that programs, servers,
                    and web sites can share data and services.<br><br> REST describes the general rules for how the data and
                    services are represented
                    through the API so that other programs will be able to correctly request and
                    receive the data and services that an API makes available. REST API has many characteristics.&nbsp;
                    REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (verbs) for operations on resources. The most common HTTP
                    methods used in REST are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>1. 'GET'</b> => Receive information about an API resource.<br>
                    <b>2. 'POST'</b> => Create an API resource.<br>
                    <b>3. 'PUT/PATCH'</b> => Update an API resource.<br>
                    <b>4. 'DELETE'</b> => Delete an API resource.<br>
                    This makes it easier to scale the API and improves performance by reducing the need to store and
                    manage session data on the server.<br><br>
                    The most common thing of using REST APIs is to deliver static resource representations in XML or
                    JSON. this architectural style allows users to download and run code in the form of Java
                    scripts.<br><br>REST APIs are widely used in web development and are the foundation for many web
                    services, including social media APIs, e-commerce platforms, and more.
